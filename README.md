The DriverPass system was requested by a business owner that wanted to address the issue of people commonly failing their driver's test. They wanted a system designed for their business that would allow them to reach their customers via an online portal where the customers could book appointments and take tests to review for the test. I believe I described the system well in the business requirements document in outlining the functional and non-functional requirements. If I were able to revise something in the document, I believe that I could have done a better job of filling out the class diagram, as I have only the necessary attributes filled in for each object. I made sure to include the required functionalities in the design documents and class diagram so that the user could achieve the minimum of what was desired. Since many of the user's functions were required to be made on software, I addressed user functionality in the functional requirements section of my business requirements document. Anything else required of the system would be non-functional requirements, which I laid out in its respective section. Dividing these two requirements was quite helpful to me in designing the system, and something I will probably continue doing into the future.
